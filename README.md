This is the Open-source version of TUSK (the Tufts University Sciences Knowledgebase), an e-learning platform for the health sciences. Installation instructions can be found under install/INSTALL.

This release is still very alpha. We guarantee nothing, aside from the opportunity to join us in a collaborative effort to build a next-generation suite of tools for e-learning.
