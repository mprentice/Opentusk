Notes for installing on Mac OS X Mountain Lion:

* GD graph drawing library

With homebrew:

  brew install libgd

GD test is failing. Can force with:

  cpanm --force GD


* Image::Magick error

No solution yet.


* XML::LibXSLT install error

To fix the error 'libxml/tree.h' file not found add libxml2 to the C
include path:

  ln -s /usr/include/libxml2/libxml /usr/local/include/libxml

This is not an ideal solution!
