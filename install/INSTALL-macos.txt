Notes for installing on Mac OS X Mountain Lion:

* GD graph drawing library

With homebrew:

  brew install libgd

GD test is failing. Can force with:

  cpanm --force GD


* Image::Magick error

No solution yet.


* XML::LibXSLT install error

To fix the error 'libxml/tree.h' file not found add libxml2 to the C
include path:

  ln -s /usr/include/libxml2/libxml /usr/local/include/libxml

This is not an ideal solution!


* DBD::mysql install error

  export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/local/mysql/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH"


* tusk.conf

  cp install/templates/conf/tusk/tusk.conf conf/tusk.conf

Edit tusk.conf to replace the Domain and add your hostname to the
Middleware->Servers section.
