Installing TUSK takes a bit of work, which makes documentation even more important. This documents attempts to provide some steps to getting the software up and running.

These instructions are geared toward a person who is familiar with Unix, comfortable with Apache, mod_perl, mod_ssl and MySQL, and isn't afraid to break something knowing it will lead to a working application.

First, make sure the core list of applications and libraries is installed on the machine. These can be found at:
http://baldrick.tusk.tufts.edu/twiki/bin/view/Documents/ServerOSPackages

download and untar tar.gz file

DATABASE
create the database and table structures by piping the mysql_structure.sql into mysql
add a user web_user (used to access all)

APACHE
edit apache/apachectl, changing server names and environments
edit apache/conf/httpd.conf, change config as needed
edit apache/conf/startup.pl, adjust settings for memory on machine
edit apache/conf/web_user_password, put password for web_user here
edit apache/lib/perl/HSDB4/Constants.pm
   - enter cms <contant manager user> and <content manager password> (used in cms versions Sep_2004 and later, doing away with individual password prompts on each page)
   - enter (or leave blank) <ldap server> and <ldap password> if using ldap (requires modification to HSDB45/LDAP.pm
   - replace <MySQL server> with ip or domain name of MySQL server

HTML
In many places in the system you'll find the use of images and text referring to Tufts University or TUSK. Most frequently this is in the html scripts located in apache/htdocs, apache/hsdb4, apache/hsdb45, apache/secure and apache/embperl.

Use of a grep (or for the bold a script to replace) is recommended to find instances and change them to the appropriate image or phrase.
