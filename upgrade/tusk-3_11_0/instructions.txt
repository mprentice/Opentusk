## This release introduces support for Unicode input for forms. 
## In achieving this, there are two major dependencies introduced:
##		* Mason 1.47 -- to enable use of Mason plugins
##		* DBD::mysql 4.020 -- to enable use of UTF-8 safe DB connections.
## You should ensure that these are installed on your system, and are 
## in the perl include path.
##
## To make TUSK Unicode-ready, the database needs to be converted to use 
## UTF-8 as the character set for all text fields. The script 
## convert-columns-utf8.pl in this directory will perform this conversion
## for you. Seperate dumps of the data and schema for TUSK databases are
## made as part of the script, but if you have the disk space, making a full
## dump in case of a catastrophe is reccomended.

## To do the conversion (you will be prompted for MySQL login info and you
## probably want to move this into the TUSK lib directory first):
./utf8-db-conversion.pl

## Run this JSON conversion script to convert existing data in hsdb45*.eval_save_data tables
./jsonify_eval_saved_answers.pl
