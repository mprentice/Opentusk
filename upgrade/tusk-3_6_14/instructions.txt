TUSK-3_6_14

This release adds one new feature to Tusk and one modification to the structure of the HSDB4::User object and table that will have long reaching
consequences.

The new feature added is "Import User Images" (found in the admin leftnav) which allows admins to upload a batch of user images to the site. 
The images are uploaded to /data/html/images/users which is defined in TUSK/Constants
The images will be used in assesments and other tools in the future.

The modification to the User object is the addition of a new int field called "uid" which will hopefully one day replace
"user_id" as the primary key for the table. Currently uid is set manually by the User object when a save is executed. It is also a unique, NOT NULL field.

**NOTE** This feature REQUIRES that the browser implement the multiple file upload feature of HTML5. At the time of writing the compatible browsers include : Firefox 3.6+ , Safari 4+ , Chrome 4+
**NOTE** A script must be run during the install to update all existing entries in the user table to have a proper uid. Details below.
**NOTE** This release requires some directory structure changes, see below.

***************************************
DATABASE CHANGES

To make proper user table changes execute the following in order:

"alter table hsdb4.user add uid int(10);"

"alter table hsdb4.user add UNIQUE(uid);"

**** now run the user_uid_script.pl 

"alter table hsdb4.user modify uid int NOT NULL;"


****************************************
DIRECTORY STRUCTURE CHANGES

To accomodate the uploaded files some changes need to be made in the data directory, they are the following:
cd /data/html
mv images images2
mkdir images
cd images
mkdir users

in summation, go do data/html, move the current images dir (which doesnt seem to be being used) to images2, recreate the images dir, then create a 
subdir in images called "users"
