####################
## This release includes some minor features in the quiz
##	and assignment tools, and some small bugfixes.
## We also noticed that link_search_query_content was missing
## a helpful index, so in order to speed up refined queries 
## we added it.


####################
## Index for link_search_query_content
## to be safe, dump the table we are about to index
mysqldump tusk link_search_query_content > link_search_query_content.dump

## then, run the following sql to add the index (this may take several minutes):
mysql tusk < lsqc_index.sql


##TUS-43: Adds functionality to sort assignments in the
##		  assignment management tool.
##
##	This feature requires the addition of a new field to 
##  the table tusk.assignment. To do so: run assignment_sort.sql   
##	(command below for Tufts U only!)
mysql tusk < assignment_sort.sql

##TUS-1353: Quiz completion report.
##
## This requires insertion of some additional permissions
## to control access to the new feature. To add these permissions,
## run quiz_completion_permissions.sql
## (command below for Tufts U only!)
mysql tusk < quiz_completion_permissions.sql


##Bugs fixed: 
##	-TUS-1367
##  -TUS-1897
