##### WHAT'S NEW?
##########

# TUSK 3.7.2 is the masonization of the eval system.  This also brings the look
# and feel of the eval system up to date with the rest of the site.
#
# Other changes include:
#    * Minor database cleanup
#    * Masonized import functionality (course students / users)
#    * Masonized grouplinks
#    * Links without a specific class declaration on them have a new hue of blue (brighter)
#    * Content of type 'URL' and 'External' will continue to be opened in a frame, but 
#      top frame will be much shorter (same goes for downloadable files)
#    * tree_box element now gets a 1px border around rows
#    * if a new phase is inserted into a case, it automatically goes to end of list - these
#      used to get inserted based on the default sort order of the phase type.
#    * problem list phase type had some default text that was displayed. this was removed
