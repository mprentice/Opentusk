<h3 class="sectionheader">About Tufts OCW</h3>
Tufts University is committed to offering the world's learners free access to its many academic resources. Tufts OpenCourseWare (OCW) seeks to
capitalize on the potential of the internet to eliminate borders and
geographic distance as obstacles to the instantaneous exchange of
knowledge and new ideas. Unlike distance learning programs that charge
tuition, provide formal instruction and limit participation,
OpenCourseWare offers all course materials free to everyone with online
access. Educators from around the world may upgrade their classes;
students may enhance their coursework or pursue self study; the general
public may glimpse the depth and breadth of what leading universities
are offering and benefit from reading lists and lectures.

<p>
OCW does not require any registration and is not a degree-granting or
certificate-granting activity. It is instead an effort to share
knowledge and make the best educational use of the Internet's
potential. The project has been embraced by students and
educators around the globe, many of whom are from areas where
educational resources are scarce or difficult to access.
</p>
<p>
Much of the course material from the health sciences schools is housed in the Tufts University Sciences Knowledgebase (TUSK) and was transformed into OCW format by TUSK staff. This website represents only a sampling of Tufts course materials online.  The course offerings represent the contributions Tufts and its faculty can make to the project's global reach by focusing on both life sciences and courses with an international component. 
</p>
<p>
While Tufts OCW faculty pride themselves on providing the most
comprehensive course content possible, in some cases the full
complement of course materials may not appear online due to
copyright and other intellectual property issues. This is particularly
true of health sciences courses where professors often draw on a wealth
of sources, making it difficult to gain all the approvals and releases
needed to include everything in a publicly available site. However,
users should find bibliographies and syllabi a fertile resource for
information.
