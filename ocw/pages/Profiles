    <div class="black_body_text">&quot;I was prompted to visit the Tufts OCW website as I am very  interested in medical education, especially in clinical epidemiology and  evidence-based medicine. In fact we are changing our curriculum from a  traditional way of teaching towards a problem-based learning  curriculum.&nbsp;When I found the Epidemiology and Biostatistics course on  Tufts OCW, I knew that it could be very important to me and to our medical  course.&nbsp;Doctors in Brazil  have difficulty getting the opportunity to work with evidence, and have little  knowledge about clinical epidemiology and statistics in their practice. I would  recommend Tufts OCW to other medical schools in Brazil, because I believe that by sharing experiences we can improve the process of teaching and learning in  medicine. With the tremendous changes that we are seeing in medicine, we need to  have a network to discuss and share experiences. I plan on  using all of the material available at the website for  teaching the Epidemiology and  Biostatistics course in the Fall 2004/2005 semesters. This course could become  the basis for our teachers and students to practice evidence-based medicine. We  know that there are many differences between countries, but we believe that we  can globalize evidences and localize decisions in medicine and health care.&quot;</div>
