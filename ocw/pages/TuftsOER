<p>
Tufts University is a leader in the Open Educational Resources (OER) movement, bringing access to educational content, tools, and infrastructure to educators, students, and self-learners. For more information about Tufts OCW, read <a href="http://dl.tufts.edu/view_pdf.jsp?pid=tufts:PB.002.001.00001" target="_blank">"Expanding the reach of health sciences education and empowering others: the OpenCourseWare initiative at Tufts University,"</a> published in <em>Medical Teacher</em>, January 2008. As a premier university with a commitment to internationalism, active citizenship, and leadership in the health sciences and environment, Tufts provides free access to high quality information to support the learning efforts of individuals around the world. Open dissemination of information, particularly to improve global health with partners in the developing world, is an important part of Tufts' mission. We invite you to explore these resources.

		  Tufts University Sciences Knowledgebase, or TUSK, is a comprehensive, open-source-based content and knowledge management software system, particularly suited for creating, managing and sharing health sciences curricula.  TUSK allows each participating institution (several in the United States, India, and East Africa) to support their own content repository, curriculum management, and curriculum delivery across all departments and schools using one integrated system that is customized to their "brand", while enabling sharing content and processes with others. TUSK provides a single, rich interface for learners, faculty, and curriculum administration. Using the standardized vocabulary of the National Library of Medicine's UMLS keywords and key concepts within its metadata, TUSK enables easy searching and reuse of materials across all disciplines. TUSK provided the infrastructure and much content for Tufts OCW.</div>

    The Visual Understanding Environment (VUE) is a free, open source application developed through a project based at Tufts University. At its core, VUE is a concept- and content-mapping application, developed to support teaching, learning and research and for anyone who needs to access and organize digital information.
<p>The benefits of concept mapping as a learning tool have been documented by over 40 years of cognitive science research. VUE provides a concept-mapping interface, which can be used as such, or as a way to aggregate and present digital content in non-linear ways. As the availability of digital information continues to increase, VUE sets itself apart as a flexible tool to help integrate, organize and contextualize electronic content from multiple worldwide sources.
<p>With a single tool in hand, scholars can use VUE to work through an entire academic task cycle: brainstorm, search, collect, organize, analyze and present information. Some of VUE's unique functionality includes federated searches, data import and visualization, map-to-slide presentation, linear and non-linear presentations, connectivity analysis, merge maps, and an upcoming SEASR and Zotero integration.</div>

			Since the 1980's, Perseus has explored both the possibilities and challenges of moving libraries online into a dynamic, networked world. Perseus offers the most comprehensive collection of content and tools to teach and learn Greco-Roman classics (particularly Greek, Latin, and Art and Archaeology) as well as other humanities, including early modern English and customized reading support for the Arabic language. Perseus continues to evolve, performing active research in how we access and use information to learn, thus working towards its primary goal of offering the widest range of source materials - linguistic, physical artifacts, historical spaces - as accessible as possible to every human being, regardless of linguistic or cultural background.

			<p>The Tufts University   Center for Engineering  Education and Outreach (CEEO) is a leader in supporting efforts to integrate  engineering into K-12 education. The CEEO is comprised of staff, graduate, and  undergraduate students to teach science, technology, engineering, and math  using the engineering design process as a learning vehicle. Our motivation  stems from our fundamental belief that the skills we help students develop are  closely connected to the transformation of our physical world into a world with  improved excitement for learning and higher quality of life.&nbsp; Sample projects include:</p>

	Tufts' Civil and Environmental Engineering Department, Geology Department, Tisch Library, and Academic Technology developed a geotechnical database for use in engineering education and research. By integrating the analysis capabilities of a Geographic Information System (GIS) with Environmental Visualization Software (EVS), students and researchers can explore civil engineering constraints for construction in downtown Boston, caused by the historic filling of land in Boston's peninsula. A customized Desktop GIS and Internet mapping application enables 2-D and 3-D visualization of Boston's subsurface soil database, acquired through the Central Artery's Big Dig project.
