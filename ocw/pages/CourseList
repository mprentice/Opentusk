	<strong>Epidemiology and Biostatistics (CMH110), Fall 2004/2005</strong><br />

	This course teaches the basic skills needed to critique the medical literature by providing a fundamental understanding of epidemiology and biostatistics. Physicians have an obligation to remain current in their field of practice and to treat patients according to accepted standards of care. This requires reading those journals that are considered the most important sources of new information in your field of medicine.<br />

	<strong>Genetics (GEN200), Fall 2005</strong><br />
	Medical genetics involves the application of genetic principles in the practice of medicine. Medical genetics encompasses diagnosis and treatment of genetic diseases, study of inheritance of diseases in families, mapping of disease genes to their chromosome locations, study of the molecular genetics and pathogenesis of inherited disorders, provision of genetic counseling for families, and recently, investigations of methods for gene therapy. 
The field of Human Genetics has expanded exponentially over the past twenty-five years. Unlike any other field, genetics represents a true integration between the basic and the clinical sciences.

	<strong>Geriatric Dentistry (DENT 0219), Summer 2005</strong><br />
	The dentist is a key member of the health delivery team. This course teaches the student how to render comprehensive oral health care and teach prevention to a dynamic, diverse and rapidly growing elderly population. Since chronology does not always equal physiology, younger patients with significant medical, physical, mental disabilities and sensory deficits are eligible for treatment in Geriatric Dentistry. Students will learn the complexity of aging, patient management and the importance of dentistry in total patient care.
In the three clinic sessions, students evaluate their patients holistically, which includes medical history, nutritional assessment, medications, diagnostic radiographs, and prevention. A comprehensive treatment plan is developed; treatment is started and is to be completed in the general practice clinics.

	<strong>International Multilateral Negotiation (DHP D224), Spring 2005</strong><br />
	This seminar is designed as an inquiry into the nature of multilateral 
	negotiation. It looks at how the tools, techniques, and rhythms of 
	multilateral negotiation is similar to bilateral negotiations and in what 
	ways - if at all - are they different. The seminar focuses on negotiated 
	decision-making in multilateral settings. It will survey process issues such 
	as: the differences between bilateral and multilateral negotiations, the 
	particular problems of negotiations involving a very large number of 
	parties, the complexities of issue-linkage, managed negotiation processes, 
	the role of coalitions, conference diplomacy, treaty negotiations, knowledge 
	in negotiation, etc. These topics are discussed in the context of case 
	studies dealing with a range of multilateral issues including international 
	security, environment, and international trade.

	<strong>Oral Public Health and Community Service Program, Summer 2005</strong><br />

	This program examines the impact of society, disparate cultures, attitudes, 
	health beliefs and risk behaviors on oral public health. The fundamental 
	principles and practices of public health, epidemiology, civic engagement, 
	and community service are presented from a practical and applied 
	perspective. The significance of oral diseases and disorders as a "silent 
	epidemic" and their grave impact on general health and well-being is 
	emphasized, including specific examples of current issues and "hot topics" 
	in oral public health. Strategies and methods to overcome existing 
	substantial impediments to oral healthcare access for the most needy, 
	vulnerable and underserved populations, is discussed from the perspective of 
	community-based healthcare systems development.

	<strong>Pathophysiology of Endocrinology (PPY224), Diabetes and Metabolism, Spring 2005</strong><br />
	This course provides a brief review of endocrine physiology. The course teaches the pathophysiology of each of the endocrine areas through didactic lectures and small group discussions. The student will learn the mechanism of action of the various medications used in the treatment of endocrine disorders as a way to emphasize physiology and pathophysiology. The concepts and facts learned during the lectures will be applied to solve clinical problems in the small group discussion sessions. The small group sessions prepare students to handle endocrine cases during their clinical years and prepare them for the USMLE exams as well.<br />

	<strong>Producing Films for Social Change (EXP-0053-CF), Fall 2005</strong><br />

	This is an intensive, hands-on editorial and production course in which students pitch their ideas and then research, report, produce, shoot, write, and edit their own short documentary films on social issues affecting the local community, the U.S., or the world. Readings and discussions focus on current news, media ethics, media literacy, the declining credibility of the press, journalists' responsibilities to the public, social justice issues, First Amendment principles, corporate media ownership, media images of women and people of color, and the powerful role of media (TV news, documentaries, new media, digital storytelling) as tools for civic engagement and positive social change. 
We will cover the basic principles and techniques of video journalism, including directing, lighting, camera work, composition, interviewing, and character development. The classroom will be run like a newsroom, working collaboratively under deadlines with editorial guidance from Senior and Executive Producers. Students work in production teams on their films. The aim of this course is to help students become media literate and to sharpen their skills as producers and consumers of news through screenings, critiques, and guest lectures by prominent journalists, filmmakers, activists, and policy makers.
