<strong>1.1 What is Tufts  OpenCourseWare?</strong></p>
<p>The ultimate vision of the Tufts OCW initiative is to  support and advance education by making high-quality content freely available  on the Web for learners and faculty across the nation and the world. Modeled  after MIT's OpenCourseWare Initiative (<a href="http://ocw.mit.edu">http://ocw.mit.edu</a>),  the Tufts OCW initiative encourages the publication and free exchange of course  materials on the World Wide Web. The venture continues Tufts’ tradition of  knowledge sharing as part of our non-profit mission and as part of Tufts  leadership in civic engagement.</p>
<p>Tufts University launched the OCW initiative with a pilot  showcase of open materials for a limited number of subjects in June of 2005.  This is a pilot proof-of-concept project that will continue based on the  results and continued funding.</p>
<p><strong>1.2 Why is Tufts doing this?</strong></p>
<p>Tufts is participating in the OCW initiative to address the  following goals:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Instill  the custom of sharing knowledge with the world as habitual practice at Tufts</li>
    <li>Reinforce  the University’s three major themes: Internationalism, Life Sciences and  Environment, and Active Citizenship</li>
    <li>Promote collaboration - &quot;One Tufts&quot;,  by bringing faculty and courses from various disciplines together in one location,  and by drawing on staff and resources from across the University for  implementation</li>
    <li>Promote  the use of the OpenCourseWare initiative</li>
    <li>Facilitate  faculty engagement with global colleagues, which can elevate teaching and  research/scholarship</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>1.3 How does Tufts OCW differ  from other types of web-based education, including distance learning?</strong></p>
<p>Tufts OCW differs from other Tufts web-based education  offerings in that it is free and open, does not provide university credit, and  grants no access to university faculty. Tufts OCW is not a distance learning  initiative. Distance learning involves the active exchange of information  between faculty and students, with the goal of obtaining some form of a credential.  Increasingly, distance learning is also limited to those willing and able to  pay for materials or course delivery. Tufts OCW is not meant to replace  degree-granting higher education or for-credit courses. Rather, the goal is to  provide the content that supports an education, whether it be for professor,  student, or self-learner.</p>
<p>Many individual faculty members at Tufts and other  universities already use the web extensively to make standard course materials  available to their students. Some colleges and universities now require a  website for every class. But to a large extent, these websites are designed for  and access is only provided to the students enrolled at these institutions. OCW  is an unprecedented effort of a much broader magnitude, as the goal is to  provide course materials free to the world.</p>
<p><strong>1.4 Who else is involved in  the OCW initiative with Tufts?</strong></p>
<p>Visit <a href="http://ocwconsortium.org/courses/ocwsites">other  OpenCourseWare sites</a> from around the world.  </p>
<p><strong>1.5 Will Tufts OCW offer  courses and degrees?</strong></p>
<p>No. Tufts OCW will make course materials freely accessible  on the World Wide Web. The Tufts OCW initiative is not a distance learning or a  degree- or certificate-granting initiative and will not offer courses for  credit or fees. Distance learning involves active interaction between faculty  and students, with the goal of obtaining credit and some form of a credential.  Typically, distance learning content is limited to those who register and pay  for materials or course delivery.</p>

<strong>2.1 How do I register to use  Tufts OCW course materials?</strong></p>
<p>Because Tufts OCW is not a distance learning or a  degree-granting initiative, there is no registration process required for users  to view course materials.</p>
<p><strong>2.2 Where are the course  materials?</strong></p>
<p>The materials are available on the webpage for each course.  Materials are grouped in standard ways: syllabus (course overview), calendar  (schedule) etc. To find out what courses are available at this time, view  complete course lists by schools on the <a href="http://ocw.tufts.edu/">Tufts  OCW Homepage</a> or the <a href="http://ocw.tufts.edu/Schools/">Schools page</a>,  or view the complete course list on the <a href="http://ocw.tufts.edu/CourseList">Courses page</a>. Once you have accessed  a particular course homepage, the left-hand navigation bar will detail what  materials are available for the course.</p>
<p><strong>2.3 How can I use Tufts OCW  course materials?</strong></p>
<p>Educators are encouraged to use the materials for curriculum  development. Students can augment their current learning by making use of the  materials offered, and self-learners can draw upon Tufts OCW for self-study or  supplementary use. Course materials offered on the Tufts OCW Website may be  used, copied, distributed, translated, and modified, but only for  non-commercial educational purposes that are made freely available to other  users under the terms defined by the <a href="http://ocw.tufts.edu/LegalNotices">Tufts  OCW Legal Notice</a>. Tufts OCW materials require appropriate source  attribution. Third party materials require permission from the appropriate  owner.</p>
<p><strong>2.4 What are the academic  prerequisites to use Tufts OCW materials?</strong></p>
<p>Because Tufts OCW is not a distance learning or a  degree-granting initiative, there is no registration process required for users  to view course materials. There are also no prerequisites for users who use  Tufts OCW course materials for their own learning. However, each course site indicates  the prerequisites and co-requisites that are required of Tufts students.</p>
<p><strong>2.5 I have seen (or I  am/represent) an individual, organization, or institution that offers to teach  Tufts courses or tutor students based on Tufts materials. Does Tufts approve or  recognize such individuals or organizations?</strong></p>
<p>No, Tufts has no relationship with, grants no special  permission to, and does not approve, endorse, or certify any organizations,  teachers, tutors, or other service providers who use educational materials available  on the <a href="http://ocw.tufts.edu/">Tufts OCW Website</a> in connection with  their services. Except for students admitted to Tufts and enrolled at the  University, Tufts does not authorize the granting of any kind of degree,  certificate, or other recognition for participation in or completion of any  course of study based on or using published Tufts course materials.</p>
<p><strong>2.6 Can I/my organization  state on our website or in our literature that we make use of Tufts OCW course  materials?</strong></p>
<p>In accordance with the terms of the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/us/legalcode">Creative  Commons license</a> used by Tufts OCW, you must give credit to Tufts and the  faculty author of the course materials anytime you use Tufts OCW materials.  However, any reference to Tufts University (including the Tufts name in any of  its forms or Tufts seals or logos) that claims or (in Tufts’ sole judgment)  gives the appearance or impression of a relationship with or endorsement by  Tufts is prohibited.</p>
<p><strong>2.7 Can I link to the Tufts  OCW Website from my website?</strong></p>
<p>Links to Tufts OCW or to courses or pages within the <a href="http://ocw.tufts.edu/">Tufts OCW Website</a> are permitted so long as the  use of the materials associated with the link is permitted under the terms of  the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/us/legalcode">Creative  Commons license</a> used by Tufts OCW, the link is freely accessible (e.g., no  restrictions or fee for access) and there is no claim, appearance, or  implication of an affiliation with or endorsement by Tufts University. Tufts  OCW cannot guarantee the persistence of any specific link other than those to  the Tufts OCW Homepage.</p>
<p><a name="Content" id="Content"><h1 class="section-level-1">3. Content</h1></a><br />
  <strong>3.1 Which courses were  selected, and why?</strong></p>
<p>Initially, Tufts was asked to provide courses in its areas  of expertise that are unique to the initiative, that is, the Life Sciences and  International Issues. Discussions among the relevant faculty and deans at Tufts  led to the selection of the pilot courses. We have also added courses from the  School of Arts and Sciences.</p>
<p><strong>3.2 Why is there such  variation in the breadth and depth of content presented on individual Tufts OCW  course websites?</strong></p>
<p>Each Tufts OCW course website is developed individually with  the participating faculty and instructors. It includes as much of the Tufts  faculty member's course materials as is available in a digital format, or can  be cost-effectively prepared and is free of intellectual property and copyright  restrictions. Tufts faculty and instructors only participate voluntarily, and  publish only as much content as they are comfortable having on a website that  is freely accessible worldwide.</p>
<p><strong>3.3 Why do some Tufts OCW  course webpages lack solutions to assignments, quizzes, and exams?</strong></p>
<p>In some cases, solutions to homework assignments, quizzes,  and exams are only discussed and presented in the classroom, and not made  available in print or electronic format to the students - or to the worldwide  community of visitors to the <a href="http://ocw.tufts.edu/">Tufts OCW Website</a>.  In other cases, the instructors plan to re-use in their Tufts classroom the assignments,  quizzes, and exams, and they do not wish to widely publish their solutions.</p>
<p><strong>3.4 How can I contribute my  own educational materials to Tufts OCW?</strong></p>
<p>The intent of Tufts OCW is that our website should reflect  the course materials being taught at Tufts. However, we encourage other  universities to create their own &quot;opencourseware&quot; in which materials  from their courses would be posted online and openly shared with the world.</p>
<p><strong>3.5 How can I make suggestions  for other courses to add?</strong></p>
<p>You can use the form on the <a href="http://ocw.tufts.edu/ContactUs">Contact Us page</a> to send us your  suggestions.</p>

Tufts OCW has  chosen the following CC license option which applies to most content published  on the site: Attribution, Noncommercial, and Share Alike. This allows for the  reuse and the creation of derivative works as long as attribution to the  original copyright holder is given and it is for noncommercial purposes. Please  see the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/us/legalcode">Creative Commons License</a> for more information.
