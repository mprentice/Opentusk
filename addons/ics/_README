These timezones are based on the tz database (timezone database). It can be read about at http://www.twinsun.com/tz/tz-link.htm
From the Site:
	In the tz database's FTP distribution the code is in the file tzcodeC.tar.gz, where C is the code's version; similarly, the data are in tzdataD.tar.gz, where D is the data's version. The following shell commands download these files to a GNU/Linux or similar host; see the downloaded README file for what to do next.

	wget 'ftp://elsie.nci.nih.gov/pub/tz*.tar.gz'
	gzip -dc tzcode*.tar.gz | tar -xf -
	gzip -dc tzdata*.tar.gz | tar -xf -
	The code lets you compile the tz source files into machine-readable binary files, one for each location. It also lets you read a tz binary file and interpret time stamps for that location.

We then break it down and convert it into ics with http://sourceforge.net/projects/vzic/

Once you have the files:
	mkdir tzdata
	cd tzdata
	tar -xzvf ../tzdata*.tar

	tar -xvf vzic-1.3.tar
	cd vzic-1.3
	vi Makefile
		OLSON_DIR = ../tzdata
		GLIB_CFLAGS = -I/usr/local/include/glib-2.0 -I/usr/local/lib/glib-2.0/include
		GLIB_LDADD = -L/usr/local/lib -lm -lglib-2.0
		CC = gcc
	make
	gather.pl
