-- INSTALLATION --

1)	sudo yum -y install python-polib



-- WORKFLOW --

1) Switch into master branch.
2) Create new branch for feature that is being translated (ex: flashcards)
3) Add translation marks in relevant files
4) After that is finished, switch into i18n-integration branch, then merge the branch you just internationalized
5) Cd into tusk_i18n folder, Run the following  commands:

tuskgettext featurename_catalog.po
pseudolocalize  featurename_catalog.po 
msgfmt pseudolocalized_ featurename_catalog.po 
mv messages.mo tusk.mo
 mv tusk.mo fr/LC_MESSAGES/
sudo /etc/init.d/httpd stop
sudo /etc/init.d/httpd start

6) Go onto local TUSK. Any words that are to be translated are marked as such: __word__. Look for any words without this marking, then make note of them. 
7) If unmarked words were found, repeat steps 3 to 6 until are relevant words are marked.
8)Once all relevant words are marked, switch back into the feature branch, then run

tuskgettext featurename_catalog.po

9)Scp featurename_catalog.po onto local machine.
10) Email catalog to translators
11)Recieve translation back, merge them into main catalog using python script.

If you want to test the translations from the translation team, then run the following.

Switch into i18n-integration
Scp all translated catalogs onto server
Rename previous master catalog
tuskgettext master_catalog.po
combine_catalogs previousmaster_catalog.po master_catalog.po
combine_catalogs (any new translations) master_catalog.po
msgfmt master_catalog.po
mv messages.mo tusk.mo
 mv tusk.mo fr/LC_MESSAGES/
sudo /etc/init.d/httpd stop
sudo /etc/init.d/httpd start
