	This script is used by Tufts
	There is an F5 load balancer presiding over our production servers
	Every little while it loads a page called lb to check and see if the server should be in the balance rotation
	If it does not find the /public/lb file then it does not add the server into the balance rotation
	To make the lb file cp this file to lb
