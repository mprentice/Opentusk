		<section-title>First Section of Text</section-title> 
		<para>This is the first paragraph that I'm typing in this new section of
		  the document. And now I'm going to make <emph>some emphasized text</emph> out
		  of something. And now I'm going to make a <user-ref
		  user-id="talkasab">reference to myself</user-ref>, which is kind of cool. And
		  now I'm going to refer to <hsdb-cite-content content-id="33">a piece of content
		  with ID 33</hsdb-cite-content>, and I can use that to make something even more
		  wonderful&#x2014;including something with an em dash.</para> 
		<itemized-list> 
		  <list-title>The list's title</list-title> 
		  <list-item>This is an item. </list-item> 
		  <list-item>This is another item </list-item> 
		  <list-item>This is a third item </list-item> 
		</itemized-list> 
		<figure><hsdb-graphic
		  content-id="file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/terry/Local%20Settings/Temporary%20Internet%20Files/Content.IE5/3MXLZYX4/new_LittleLogo%5B2%5D.gif"
		  width="301" height="65" description="The HSDB Logo"/> 
		  <caption>This is some text which we might include in the caption, which
			 can include some <emph>emphasized</emph> stuff and some <strong>strong</strong>
			 stuff.</caption> 
		</figure> 
		<para>This is another block of text to be used inside this piece of
		  content. It's the beginning of yet another paragraph. So far, it seems like
		  this could work great. Can I make some <emph>emphasized</emph> text to go with
		  my system? Yes, it seems I can. What about some <strong>bold</strong> text to
		  go along with it? Yes, that's no problem, too. What about super-scripts and
		  sub-scripts? What about, for example, Ca<sup>2+</sup>? Yes, that works great as
		  well. And presumably, subscripting works, too (X<sub>2</sub>; yup, it does).
		  Well, this is actually going pretty well. And what about some Greek letters,
		  like&alpha;? Well, that doesn't look too nice here. </para>

		<section-title>Another Section</section-title> 
		<para>This is a paragraph in the second section of text, and I can work
		  with it however I please. It seems to make things reasonable to work
		  with.</para> 
		<para>So this is a whole new paragraph. And now what do I want to put in?
		  Maybe something <emph>emphasized</emph>, or maybe something
		  <strong>bolded</strong> so that we can work with it.</para> 
		<para>And this is another paragraph.</para>

		<definition-data>Fred's friend, but he's a nice guy, instead of a big
