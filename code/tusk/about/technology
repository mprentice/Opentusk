<h3>Technologies to Run TUSK</h3>
<ul>
<li>Servers:At Tufts, TUSK runs on a series of SUN servers running Solaris 8. It has been adapted to run on Linux  (Intel Hardward). </li>
<li>Application Software:TUSK is Mod_pero enabled, Apache HTTP server accessing a MySQL database server.</li>


<h3>System Design Priniples</h3>
<ul>
<li>Structured data which permits the desired level of content integration using a database system</li>
<li>Object-oriented programming interface designed to hide the details of the database system and simplify common operations</li>
<li>Interfaces and tools  created using the programming interface as a foundation. The display interfaces allow users appropreate access to the data.</li>
<il> Authoring tools are implemented to permit data owners to maintain them within the TUSK system.</li>
<li> Programs are created which allow TUSK systems to incorporated data from other sources.</li>
<li>Simple administrative tools are crafted to simplify the tasks of centralized maintenance of data</li>
<li> Design tools for flexibility and extensibility to allow new applications to be developed as rapidly and inexpensively as possible</li>
