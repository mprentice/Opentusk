<h3>To create and share software and content to enhance teaching and learning.  </h3>
<p>The software architecture, the Tufts University Sciences Knowledgebase, TUSK, is built using open source software.  The architecture was constructed to facilitate content integration, student interaction with content and knowledge management.  Through participation in a number of open source initiatives we will foster integration of content across Tufts health sciences schools and external institutions.  Through partnerships with external institutions we will share our software architecture (<a href="http://tusk.tufts.edu/about/partners">partners</a>).</p> 
<p>To accomplish this we will:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Participate in Open Source Standards Development</b></li>
<p>We will use and participate in the development of software standards including but not be limited to <a href="http://www.okiproject.org/">the OKI project, </a>, <a href="http://shibboleth.internet2.edu/">the Internet 2 - Shibboleth project,</a>, and <a href="http://www.medbiq.org/">Medbiquitous</a> so that software architectures enables content sharing. </p>
<li><b>Participate in Open Source Content Management/Creation Tools Development</b></li>
<p>We will work as partners with other open source course and content management initiatives such as <a href="http://www.sakaiproject.org/">Sakai</a> and Educommons so that Tufts and external institutions will have the maximum flexibility to use the software which best meets the institutions needs regarding teaching and learning.  </p>
<li><b>Participate in Open Education Resource Sharing</b></li>
<p>We will share  Tufts content through open education resource initiatives  funded by the <a href="http://www.hewlett.org/Programs/Education">Hewlett Foundation</a> such as the OpenCourseWare initiative by both sharing our content through <a href="http://ocw.tufts.edu">Tufts OpenCourseWare</a>,  by creating tools within TUSK to enable all institutions who are using TUSK to easily share content, and by using standard content formats and metadata to enable the easy transfer of  Tufts OCW content into other systems at external institutions. </p>
<li><b>Provide Content Metadata to Enable Teachers and Learners to effectively use Tufts Content</b></li>
<p>To enable content sharing Tufts content will meet the <a href="http://www.imsglobal.org/content/packaging/index.html">IMS content packing and learning object model standards</a>.  TUSK tools for content sharing will enable the use of these standards by others. We will also label Tufts content using an open controlled vocabulary,<a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/"> UMLS </a> developed by the National Library of Medicine so that teachers and learners at Tufts and external institutions may more easily identify content which meets their needs. </p>
</ul>
