<H3>TUSK Overview</H3>
<p>
The Tufts University Sciences Knowledgebase, TUSK, is a dynamic multimedia knowledge management system, which supports faculty and students in teaching and learning   Begun in 1995, it serves all Tufts health sciences schools and programs including the Medical, Dental and Veterinary Schools.   It provides a portal to an integrated body of knowledge and means to personally organize the vast array of health information through its related applications.  All Tufts students and faculty can access and integrate material from any course or school or year.   TUSK is web-based and password protected making curricular material available regardless of time, place, or platform.  In the 2002-2003 academic year, the database had over three million content hits.  The users login to TUSK is personalized, with the homepage displaying announcements appropriate to the user as well as current courses, course discussions and posted evaluations.  Users may create personal notes for any document or image and create collections of content and notes as needed.    In 2001, TUSK, was awarded the prestigious CIO Enterprise Value Award.  This was the first time the award had ever been granted to a university.  It also won a 1996 Bright Idea Award from Information Dimensions.  Over the last 5 years posters, papers and demonstrations on TUSK were accepted at AMIA, Slice of Life and the AAMC, Special Libraries Association, MLA, IMLA, and just recently for MEDINFO in Sept 2004.  Last March TUSK was described in Academic Medicine in a special issue. There are two external installations of the TUSK infrastructure, one at New York Medical College and the other at the Nelson Mandela Medical School at the University of Kwazulu-Natal in Durbin, South Africa. </p>
