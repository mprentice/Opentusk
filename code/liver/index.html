<p>Although the material presented on this web site is freely available,
its major function is to provide essential background information for
recent advances which constitute the 4th edition of The Liver: Biology
and Pathobiology, edited by Irwin M. Arias, James Boyer, Frank Chisari,
Nelson Fausto, David Schachter and David Shafritz, and published in 2001
by Lippincott Williams and Wilkins, Philadelphia, PA, USA. ISBN
0-78117-2390-6</p>
<p>In this manner the 1040 page 4th edition is substantially smaller than
its 1628 predecessor which was published in 1994.  The 4th edition
focuses on exciting, new advances of the past
five years which are supplemented on the web site by 32 outstanding
review chapters from the 3rd edition.  All chapters in the 4th edition
are cross-referenced with information provided on the web site.</p>

<p>The editors and publisher hope that this novel presentation achieves our
objectives and meets with the approval of those interested in the
biology and pathobiology of the liver.</p>

<p>These chapters are being hosted by the Tufts University's Health Science Library and the Tufts University Health Sciences Database.  A note about navigation:you can return to on-line chapters' home page by clicking on "The Liver" icon in the header.</p>
