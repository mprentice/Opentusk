      <p>A twenty-eight member interdisciplinary team designed The Cancer Pain 
        Education Resource (CAPER) World Wide Web site. It was developed by the 
        Cancer Education Module for the Management of Pain (CEMMP) program which 
        is funded by the National Cancer Institute (Grant R25 CA65005, funded 
        from 1996-2000). The CEMMP program developed, implemented, and is evaluating 
        a portable cancer pain education component for medical, nursing and residency 
        training curricula. The CEMMP team is interdisciplinary including renowned 
        pain and cancer specialists and a team of academic clinicians from both 
        medicine and nursing, biological scientists, social scientists, library 
        scientists, pharmacists, and others. The CEMMP team collaborated to develop 
        this program in response to the many studies that confirm the inability 
        of medical students, residents, physicians, nurses, and nursing students 
        to provide appropriate cancer pain management, in part due to limited 
        educational opportunities in professional education. Two medical and three 
        nursing schools are participating in the CEMMP program. </p>

     <h3>THE CEMMP CURRICULUM</h3>
      <p>The curriculum includes cancer pain assessment; the pathophysiology of 
        cancer pain; pharmacological and non/pharmacological management; pain 
        management through collaborative care; cultural diversity in the expression 
        of pain and receptivity to treatments; the role of the family in effective 
        pain management; and pain management under managed care. The objective 
        of the program was to identify the optimal educational contexts, formats 
        and timing for transfer of knowledge to practice. Materials and teaching 
        methods have been developed for all years of professional physician and 
        nurse education. </p>
